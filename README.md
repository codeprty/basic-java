Q1. Write a program that:
    1. Declares a boolean variable called my_boolean.
    2. Initializes it to the boolean values of TRUE.
    3. Prints the value of my_boolean.
    4. Re-assigns my_boolean to the value of test.
    5. Prints the value of my_boolean.

Q2. Write a program that:
    1. Declares an int variable called my_int.
    2. Initializes it to the value of num1.
    3. Prints the value of my_int.
    4. Re-assigns it to the value of num2.
    5. Prints the value of my_int.
    6. Re-assigns it to the value of num3.
    7. Prints the value of my_int.

Q3. Write a program that:
    1. Declares a double variable called my_double.
    2. Initializes my_double to the value of zero.
    3. Prints the value of my_double.
    4. Re-assigns my_double to the value of one.
    5. Prints the value of my_double.

Q4. Use two print statements to write the following String:
    Hello! Welcome to the Programming Foundation Class!

Q5. Use the variable x to write a program where x is a positive integer. The program should check if x falls within the ranges 0 to 50 or 80 to 100 (inclusive). If x is within either range, print:
    _is between 0 and 50 or 80 and 100.
    (The blank should replaced with the value of x.)
  
    If x does not fall within these ranges, the program should do nothing. Note: The numbers 0, 50, 80, and 100 are included in the valid ranges.
  
    Type Casting: Convert x to a string using String.valueof(x).

    Expected Output:
    - If x is 8, then the output would be: 8 is between 0 and 50 or 80 and 100.
    - If x is 80, then the output would be: 80 is between 0 and 50 or 80 and 100.
    - If x is 100, then the output would be: 100 is between 0 and 50 or 80 and 100.
  
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      int x = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      // your code
    }
